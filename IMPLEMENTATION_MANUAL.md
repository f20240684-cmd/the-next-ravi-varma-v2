# Implementation Manual: The Next Ravi Varma

> **Note (October 2026):** this manual describes the original project scaffold. For the current,
> verified workflow — curated 200→134-image dataset, BLIP-VQA captions, aspect buckets, the
> `stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5` base model and the Colab notebook — follow the
> **"Reproducing the experiment"** section of [README.md](README.md). `IMPLEMENTATION_MANUAL.pdf`
> is a snapshot of this older text.

This is a hands-on walkthrough for getting the project running, start to finish. It assumes no
prior familiarity with the codebase. Follow it top to bottom the first time.

## 0. Decide your path first

Training a LoRA needs a GPU. Everything else (dataset prep, the app UI shell, evaluation
plumbing) works on a plain laptop. Pick one:

| Path | What you need | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Google Colab** (recommended) | A free Google account | Actually training a model, with zero local setup |
| **B. Your own GPU machine** | An NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM, CUDA installed | Repeat training runs, faster iteration |
| **C. Local, CPU only** | Any computer | Preparing your dataset before uploading it; browsing the code; generating images is possible but slow (minutes per image) |

You can mix these: prepare your dataset locally (Path C), train on Colab (Path A), then bring the
trained checkpoint back to your laptop to generate images.

---

## 1. Get the code onto your machine

Unzip the file you were given:

```bash
unzip the-next-ravi-varma.zip
cd the-next-ravi-varma
```

You should see folders named `configs/`, `data/`, `src/`, `scripts/`, `app/`, `notebooks/`, etc.
If you don't, you unzipped in the wrong place — `cd` into the folder that directly contains
`README.md`.

---

## 2. Install Python dependencies

**Requires Python 3.10 or newer.** Check with `python3 --version`.

### Path B or C (local machine)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

This installs torch, diffusers, transformers, etc. It's a big download (a few GB) — that's
normal. If you're on Path C (CPU only) and don't have a GPU, `pip install torch` still works, it
just installs the CPU-only build.

### Path A (Colab)

Don't install anything locally yet — you'll do this inside the Colab notebook in Step 5.

### If something fails to install

- `bitsandbytes` and `xformers` are commented out for CPU-only machines in `requirements.txt` —
  they only work with an NVIDIA GPU + CUDA. If you're on Path C, that's expected and fine; the
  code auto-detects their absence and falls back to standard optimizers/attention.
- If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails partway through, try installing torch by itself
  first (`pip install torch`), then re-run the full command.

### Sanity check

```bash
python3 -c "import ravi_varma; print('OK')"
pytest -v
```

You should see `OK` and (if you didn't install the full ML stack) most tests passing — a few may
be skipped if CLIP/torch aren't present, which is expected and not an error.

---

## 3. Get training images

You need a folder of images to train on. Two options:

### Option 1: Auto-download public-domain paintings

```bash
python scripts/download_dataset.py --limit 40
```

This pulls Raja Ravi Varma reproductions from Wikimedia Commons (public domain — he died in
1906) along with licensing metadata. Needs internet access. 40 images is a reasonable starting
size; you can lower or raise `--limit`.

### Option 2: Use your own images

1. Put image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`) directly into `data/raw/`.
2. Create `data/metadata/metadata.jsonl` by hand, one line per image:
   ```json
   {"image": "my_photo_01.jpg", "caption": null, "artist": "Raja Ravi Varma", "source": "my own scan", "year": null, "title": null}
   ```
   (Leave `"caption": null` — you'll generate captions in Step 4.)

**Only use images you actually have the right to use.** See `data/README.md` for more on this.

### Check the dataset is usable

```bash
python scripts/validate_dataset.py
```

Read the output. It will tell you:
- How many images it found and how many are actually usable
- Any corrupt files, duplicates, or images that are too small (below 384px on the short side)
- Whether captions exist yet (they won't, until Step 4 — that's expected)

If it says "0 valid samples," fix the errors it lists before moving on. Small warnings are fine.

---

## 4. Generate captions

Every training image needs a text caption. Two ways to do this:

```bash
# With a real image-captioning AI model (needs torch/transformers, works on CPU but slow)
python scripts/generate_captions.py --write-metadata

# Without any AI model — instant, but very basic captions (lighting/color only)
python scripts/generate_captions.py --no-vlm --write-metadata
```

Either way, this writes a caption for every image into `data/metadata/metadata.jsonl` and into
individual files under `data/captions/`. Open a couple of the `.json` files in `data/captions/`
to see what was generated — if the automatic captions are poor, you can hand-edit
`data/metadata/metadata.jsonl` directly (it's a plain text file, one JSON object per line).

---

## 5. Resize images and build the training manifest

```bash
python scripts/prepare_dataset.py
```

This resizes every image to 512×512, crops it, and writes `data/processed/manifest.jsonl` — the
file the trainer actually reads. If it reports fewer images than you expected, check the log
output above it for "skipping ... no caption found" or "unreadable" messages.

**If you're headed to Colab (Path A):** stop here, then upload the whole project folder (or at
least `data/` and `configs/`) to Google Drive or directly into the Colab session — see Step 6.

---

## 6. Train the LoRA

### Path A: Google Colab

1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) and upload
   `notebooks/03_lora_training.ipynb`.
2. **Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (T4 is fine, free tier).**
3. Run the cells top to bottom. The notebook will:
   - Check the GPU is present (`nvidia-smi`)
   - Install dependencies
   - Let you mount Google Drive and copy your `data/` folder in (or clone your own git repo if
     you pushed one)
   - Validate → caption → prepare (safe to re-run even if you did this locally already)
   - Train — there's a quick 50-step smoke test cell first; uncomment the full run once that
     works
   - Generate a couple of test images
   - Zip up the trained checkpoint and download it

4. Unzip the downloaded checkpoint into `checkpoints/lora/ravi_varma/` on your own machine.

### Path B: Your own GPU machine

```bash
python scripts/train_lora.py --config configs/lora_sd15.yaml
```

First, try a fast smoke test to make sure everything works before committing to a full run:

```bash
python scripts/train_lora.py --config configs/lora_sd15.yaml --max-train-steps 50
```

If that finishes without errors in a few minutes, run the full version (drop `--max-train-steps`,
or edit `configs/lora_sd15.yaml`'s `training.max_train_steps`, default 1500).

Training writes checkpoints periodically to `checkpoints/lora/ravi_varma/checkpoint-<step>/` and
the final weights to `checkpoints/lora/ravi_varma/`. If it's interrupted, re-running the same
command resumes automatically from the latest checkpoint.

**Watch training progress:**
```bash
tensorboard --logdir outputs/logs
```
then open the URL it prints.

### Path C: CPU only

Not recommended — LoRA training on CPU can take many hours to days even for a small dataset.
Use Path A instead.

---

## 7. Generate images

Once `checkpoints/lora/ravi_varma/` contains files (not empty):

```bash
python scripts/generate.py --prompt "Arjuna standing before Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra"
```

This prints the file paths of the saved image and its metadata. Check the printed metadata's
`"lora_loaded"` field — if it says `false`, the script couldn't find your trained checkpoint (check
`configs/generation.yaml`'s `model.lora_path` points to the right folder) and it generated with
the plain base model instead, which won't look like Ravi Varma's style.

Useful flags:
```bash
python scripts/generate.py --prompt "..." --seed 42          # reproducible output
python scripts/generate.py --prompt "..." --steps 40 --guidance-scale 8.0
python scripts/generate.py --prompt "..." --pose-image ref.jpg --controlnet-type openpose
```

---

## 8. Use the web dashboard (optional, easier)

Instead of the command line, launch the browser UI:

```bash
python app/app.py
```

Open the local URL it prints (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`). You get:
- **Generate tab** — type a scene, adjust sliders, click Generate
- **Advanced Controls** — shows your current model config
- **Evaluation tab** — score a generated image against your reference images
- **About tab** — project background and limitations

The top of the page always shows whether your LoRA checkpoint is loaded.

---

## 9. Evaluate results (optional)

Put a handful of real Ravi Varma images (not used in training) into `data/reference/`, then:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --input outputs/generated --reference data/reference
```

This writes `outputs/evaluations/report.csv` scoring every generated image on:
- **Text-image alignment** — does the image match its prompt (CLIP score)
- **Style similarity** — how close it is, in a rough embedding sense, to your reference images

These are comparative signals, not proof of quality or authenticity — treat them as one input
among several (your own eye is the other one).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ravi_varma'` | Run `pip install -e .` from the project root |
| `Cannot run LoRA training: missing or broken packages [...]` | You're missing torch/diffusers/etc, or on Path C without a real ML install — use Colab (Path A) |
| Dataset validation says "0 valid samples" | Check `data/raw/` actually has images, and they're at least 384px on the short side |
| Captions look wrong/empty | Edit `data/metadata/metadata.jsonl` by hand, or re-run `generate_captions.py` without `--no-vlm` |
| `prepare_dataset.py` prepared fewer images than expected | Look for "skipping ... no caption found" warnings just above — usually a caption is missing for that image |
| Generated images don't look like Ravi Varma's style at all | Check the printed metadata says `"lora_loaded": true`; if `false`, your `configs/generation.yaml` `model.lora_path` isn't pointing at your trained checkpoint |
| CUDA out of memory during training | Lower `training.train_batch_size` (already 1 by default) or increase `training.gradient_accumulation_steps` in `configs/lora_sd15.yaml`; make sure `training.gradient_checkpointing: true` |
| Colab session disconnects mid-training | Re-run `train_lora.py` — it auto-resumes from the last saved checkpoint under `checkpoints/lora/ravi_varma/checkpoint-<step>/` |

## Quick reference: the whole pipeline in one block

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .
python scripts/download_dataset.py --limit 40
python scripts/validate_dataset.py
python scripts/generate_captions.py --write-metadata
python scripts/prepare_dataset.py
python scripts/train_lora.py --config configs/lora_sd15.yaml   # or do this step on Colab
python scripts/generate.py --prompt "your scene here"
python app/app.py
```
